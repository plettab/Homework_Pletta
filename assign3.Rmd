# Problem 1

### Calculating proportion of rides made on a given day where Sunday is the given day

```{r}
wmata$Date <- ymd(wmata$Date)

Sunday <- wmata%>%
  filter(., wday(Date) == 07)%>%
  group_by(., month(Date, label = TRUE))%>%
  summarize(., ridecount = n())

print(Sunday)
```

### Proportion of ridership vs day of week

```{r}
bplot <- wmata%>%
  filter(., year(Date) != 2004 & year(Date) != 2005)%>%
  mutate(weekday = wday(Date, label = TRUE))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = weekday, y = Total)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Days of the Week", y = "Proportion of Total Rides") +
  ggtitle("WMATA Ridership")
```

```{r bplot, echo=FALSE}
plot(bplot)
```

## Problem 2

### leap years

```{r}
dates = c(2024, 3021, 2000, 1800, 800, 5050, 600,7156)

dates[as.logical(sapply(dates, function(year) (year %% 4 == 0 & year %% 100 != 0) | (year %% 400 == 0)))]
```
